This bash function will expand functions and aliases before running sudo.

To use it, place a source ~/.sudo.bash (for example) in your .bashrc
after copying the code to your ~/.sudo.bash, or copy the full code to your .bashrc.

Then, simply use sudo as you would before.

This function handles all sudo arguments. There is one extra argument, -x, which
expands arguments as you, not as root. This is needed in some corner cases.
